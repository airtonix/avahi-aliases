# Please note

> Use the insights button and find an updated fork. I am no longer using Vagrant.

This fork is on [github.com/till](https://github.com/till) ~~and actually **maintained**~~. I currently target Vagrant with Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) and Python 2.7 to keep this service running there.

All additions are welcome. :)
